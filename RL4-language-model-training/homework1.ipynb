    "# Homework 1\n",
    "\n",
    "The learning goals of this first hands-on sheet are: \n",
    "* to make sure that you can execute code on your machines or on Google Colab in order to experiment with LMs and RL yourself!\n",
    "* to familiarize yourself with the [HuggingFace library](https://medium.com/nlplanet/two-minutes-nlp-beginner-intro-to-hugging-face-main-classes-and-functions-fb6a1d5579c4) which provides many pretrained LMs and handy tools for working with them,\n",
    "* to develop basic intuitions about core RL concepts,\n",
    "* and to train your first RL agent!\n",
    "\n",
    "Most importantly, the homework is intended to showcase important practical aspects, provide space for learning how to find solutions to practical problems, and further conceptual understanding of the topics we discuss in class. It is *not* meant to dismay you. Therefore, even if you don't have a lot of ML / programming / technical background, you are warmly encouraged to take on the tasks, ask questions and discuss any concerns you have (with fellow students or me). There are also some hints and links to resources throughout the tasks which may help you get information which will help solving the tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Homework logistics\n",
    "\n",
    "* You will have two weeks to complete the assignment (until Wed, November 8th, 12:30pm).\n",
    "* **Please do and submit your homework by yourself!**\n",
    "* However, you are warmly encouraged to ask questions and help each other, without posting full solutions, via active discussions in the dedicated Forum space on Moodle (\"Homework 1\"). Most active participants of the Forum discussions will earn some extra points for their grade!\n",
    "* Please submit your solutions via Moodle. You will find a quiz called \"Homework 1\" with questions and answer fields corresponding the respective exercise numbers listed below. \n",
    "* If you have questions or difficulties with the homework, please try to solve them with the help of your fellow students via Forum. However, I will also offer a **consultation session on Tuesday, October 31st, 2pm-4pm, on Zoom**, under the usual class link. Also don't hesitate to reach out to me via email if you have any questions, struggle or feel overwhelmed."

    "## Preliminaries\n",
    "\n",
    "The exercises below will require you to execute Python code. You can do so either on your own machine, or by using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) (free, only requires a Google account). You can easily do the latter by pressing the Colab icon at the top of the webook's page.\n",
    "You are encouraged to use the Colab option to avoid complications with local package installations etc.\n",
    "To speed up the execution of the code on Colab (especially Exercise 1), you can use the available GPU. For that, before executing your code, navigate to Runtime > Change runtime type > GPU > Save.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if you do want to run the code locally on your machine, I strongly encourage you to create an environment (e.g., with Conda) before you install any dependencies, and please keep in mind that pretrained language model weights might take up quite a bit of space on your hard drive or might require high RAM for prediction. In particular, the model used in these exercises requires 6GB disc space and **around 8GB RAM** for stable training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the class uses PyTorch. For those of you who wish to complete final projects which include programming, you are also free to use TensorFlow for that (but I may be able to provide less support with that)."
