# Outlook & Recap

In this session, we take a brief detour to a different branch of RL, *inverse reinforcement learning*. This concludes the class, before a recap of the contents throughout the semester is provided.

The slides for the session can be found [here](<https://polina-tsvilodub.github.io/RL4-language-model-training/13a-RL-outlook-summary.pdf>).
