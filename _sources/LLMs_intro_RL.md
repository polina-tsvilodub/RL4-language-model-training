# Language Model Training & Introduction to RL

In this session, the familiarization with the core concepts around language models is wrapped up. Training of language models is shortly discussed, so as to recap terms which are important for understanding fine-tuning of LMs with RL.
Furthermore, a conceptual motivation and a high-level introduction to reinforcement learning (RL) is provided.

## Transformers, Training and RL

In this session, some additional details of the transformers architecure are discussed. Then, teacher-forcing based training of language models is briefly reviewed. This concludes the basic introduction / recap of core language models.
The second part of the session motivates reinforcement learning and briefly situates it in the field of machine learning. Then, core concepts of RL like states, actions, policy etc. are introduced. The introduction is rather informal; the main goal is to develop some intuitions about these terms.

Slides for the session can be found [here](<https://polina-tsvilodub.github.io/RL4-language-model-training/02a-LLMs-training-RL.pdf>).

## Further materials (optional)

Below, further background materials on langauge models can be found. Additionally, resources for trying language models hands-on and preparing for the practical parts of the class are provided.

## Homework

The first homework is out! In this homework, you will get a chance to try concepts we discussed so far hands-on. Please find the exercise sheet and all instructions on the next page.
